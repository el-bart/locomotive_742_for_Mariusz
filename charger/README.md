# USB-C charger

in case model discahrged (e.g. under a snow cap), it can be charged via magnetic port, via USB-C.
it can be connected to a phone or a power bank to get current from.
current is limited to just under 1A.

5V fan is used to cool the transistor.
it's needed if it operates at closed-circuit on output or when high current is needed at low voltage.
